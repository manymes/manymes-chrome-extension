manymes-chrome-extension
========================

Manymes surfs independently on websites to disguise the users identity by creating data-trash.
The respective topics are changeable by using a character-configurator.
Each one of these character represents a topic and thus a certain number of search terms.
In contrast to existing plugins like ghostery, users have the opportunity to fight active against tracking and unwanted cookies.
